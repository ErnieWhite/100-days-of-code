### Day 0: March 28th, 2022

**Today's Progres**: Created the initial Java MVC application

**Thoughts:** Tried to create the repo on github and then create the project in IntelliJ, but could not figure out how to get IntelliJ to treat it as a Java project.  Ended up creating the project in IntelliJ and then sharing it to github from withing IntelliJ

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
